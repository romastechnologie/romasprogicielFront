                                        about the target audience.</p>

                                        In either case, you'll need good time management skills to keep

                                        minor adjustments to a site. You'll find it simpler to edit
                                        templates, improve typefaces, or change item placements if you have

                                        Most businesses employ a certain font or typography so that clients
                                        can quickly distinguish them from their rivals. Since designers now
                                        have access to a wider variety of fonts, firms may more easily and
                                        precisely communicate their brands through typography.</p>
