                        <p>The best thing is location and drive through the forest. The resort is 35km from
                            Ramnagar. The gardens are well kept and maintained. Its a good place for
                            relaxation away from the city noise. The staff is very friendly and overall we
                            had a really good & fun time, thanks to staff member - Bhairav, Rajat, Gunanand,
                            Lokesh & everyone else. And also we went for an adventurous night safari and saw
                            barking deers, tuskar elephant.</p>

                            between the staff members. Receptionsit full of attitude. Arrogant staff. Except
                            good view there is nothing great in this property.Resort is 35 kms away from
                            Ramnagar Town.</p>
