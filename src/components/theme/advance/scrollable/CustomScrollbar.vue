    <Card3 titleClass="mb-0" colClass="col-xl-6" pre="true" preClass="f-m-light mt-1" headerTitle="true"
        title="Custom Scrollbar" :desc="desc">
        <perfect-scrollbar class="vertical-scroll scroll-demo" :settings="settings4">
            <h5 class="pb-2">Custom Scrollbar </h5>
            <p>I'm quite interested in learning more about <em class="txt-danger">custom scrollbars</em> because
                they are becoming more and more common.</p>
            <div class="scrollbar-images"><img class="img-fluid" src="@/assets/images/banner/1.jpg" alt="banner">
            </div>
            <p>
                There are various justifications for customizing a scrollbar. For instance, the default scrollbar
                can cause an app's user interface to look inconsistent across various operating systems. In this
                case, having a single style is helpful.</p>
            <p>
                I never had the opportunity to learn about CSS scrollbar customization, but I have always been
                interested in doing so. I'll take the chance to learn more about them and share my trip in this
                essay.</p>
            <p>
                One crucial point to remember is that, depending on the design, a scrollbar may operate either <em
                    class="txt-danger">horizontally or vertically</em> . Additionally, it might alter when you work
                on a website that is global and operates in both left-to-right and right-to-left orientations.</p>
